    <h2>A Simple Overview of Hornloaded Loudspeakers</h2>

    <!--This (p)aragraph section is the beginning of a body text, in this
    case just a simple intro.-->

    <p> The acoustical amplification of sound has been wielded by humans since antiquity, and
        with the advent of electrically induced sound reproduction in the midst of the
        industrial revolution, the whole process of saving sounds and playing them back
        became a complicated new art-science. From infinite baffle, to direct radiating,
        to electrostatic panels and even controlled arcs of plasma, there are so many interesting
        ways to make and remake sound. I tend to favor older designs that rely on the
        natural laws of acoustics to recreate sound rather than using computational
        digital magic. Below I picked the three designs that I've known about the longest.</p>

    <!--This header (3) section is simply a smaller heading, which helps to break up
    and organize the flow of the page-->

    <h3>Three of my favorite designs:</h3>
